            'During my undergraduate years, Georgia Tech provided extraordinary growth and opportunity. My four years of phenomenal professors across different disciplines encouraged me to find my passion for learning. My involvement at Georgia Tech Swim Club enriched my experience and surrounded me with a group of lifelong friends. My experience lifeguarding at the GT McAuley Aquatic Center helped me to develop my leadership and confidence and deal with high stress situations calmly. My two semesters abroad in Hong Kong and Ireland humbled me to explore other cultures and this world. While designing a space flight mission concept and formulating business plan idea, I learned that effective communication leads to quality results.',

            'I supported real-time telemetry operations during flight testing. Telemetry not only determines where the flight controls needs to be adjusted but is also essential to pilot safety. From that data, I analyzed and processed them to report results and conclusions. I\'ve given a training about the telemetry screens, because there\'s a large amount of information and data used to monitor flights, which can be overwhelming. I also wrote a test plan with test points to verify software functionality and corrections.',
            'One of the main lessons I\'ve learned is to draw from different people and sources. When there are so many flight test disciplines in the program, it\'s difficult to know everything about the aircraft, so drawing information from different sources not only broadens your perspective on an issue, but also ensures that the solution is in the right direction.',
            'One thing I\'ve realized about myself is that I tended to rush through my work, which can lead to mistakes. When my team and I worked on the training presentation, we tweaked it until it properly conveyed the information we wanted. Over time, I took more time to check with my team to receive meaningful feedback for projects.'

Throughout the course of the internship, I mostly focused on the projects I was given but not enough on requesting feedback. Hence, if I were to do it differently, I would have treated it more as an opportunity to learn and make mistakes.'
