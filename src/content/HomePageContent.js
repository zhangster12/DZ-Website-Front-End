            'My team works on the flight controls and handling qualities of the Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion. The 53K is a heavy-lift cargo helicopter that will be delivered to the US Marine Corps and will replace the previous 53E.',
            'I supported real-time telemetry operations during flight testing. Telemetry not only determines where the flight controls needs to be adjusted but is also essential to pilot safety. From that data, I analyzed and processed them to report results and conclusions. I‚Äôve given a training about the telemetry screens, because there‚Äôs a large amount of information and data used to monitor flights, which can be overwhelming. I also wrote a test plan with test points to verify software functionality and corrections.',
            'One of the main lessons I‚Äôve learned is to draw from different people and sources. When there are so many flight test disciplines in the program, it‚Äôs difficult to know everything about the aircraft, so drawing information from different sources not only broadens your perspective on an issue, but also ensures that the solution is in the right direction.',
            'One thing I‚Äôve realized about myself is that I tended to rush through my work, which can lead to mistakes. When my team and I worked on the training presentation, we tweaked it until it properly conveyed the information we wanted. Over time, I took more time to check with my team to receive meaningful feedback for projects.'

I supported the Strategic Weapons System (SWS) Ashore program, a facility to provide long-term shore-based testing to submarine missile systems. The program will play an important role testing for the Columbia-class submarine to replace the Ohio submarine.',
            'Over summer 2018, I helped develop systems engineering plans for SWS Ashore. I created testing timelines and test plan definitions, prepared JRC input for the Navy Critical Design Review, and updated existing test plans.',
            'This internship was very rewarding, and I learned a great deal about systems engineering. Afterwards, I realized was that I could have been more vocal and asked more questions. Throughout the course of the internship, I mostly focused on the projects I was given but not enough on requesting feedback. Hence, if I were to do it differently, I would have treated it more as an opportunity to learn and make mistakes.'

            'Georgia Tech provided extraordinary growth and opportunity. My four years of phenomenal professors across different disciplines encouraged me to find my passion for learning. My involvement at Georgia Tech Swim Club enriched my experience and surrounded me with a group of lifelong friends. My experience lifeguarding at the GT McAuley Aquatic Center helped me to develop my leadership and confidence and deal with high stress situations calmly. My two semesters abroad in Hong Kong and Ireland humbled me to explore other cultures and this world. While designing a space flight mission concept and formulating business plan idea, I learned that effective communication leads to quality results.',
