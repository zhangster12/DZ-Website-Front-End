            'I\'m currently a Bioengineering Master\' student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I also graduated with a Bacholor\'s in Aerospace Engineering in May 2019. I created this website during the Covid-19 pandemic, because I wanted to learn new skills and have a new avenue for self-expression and creativity.',
            'Since I was young, I\'ve always been fascinated by space exploration and science. My interest was sparked when I visited the Smithsonian Udvar Hazy Air and Space Museum, where learned about the Opportunity and Spirit Mars rovers. Since then, I\'ve continued learning more and majored in Aerospace Engineering. Recently, I\'ve become more interested in biology and aging, and now, I wish to conduct research and develop new technologies. I also like to keep myself busy by learning new skills such as programming and reading new books.',
