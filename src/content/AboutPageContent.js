            'I’m currently a flight controls engineer at Lockheed Martin in Patuxent River, Maryland. I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a degree in Aerospace Engineering on May 2019. I created this website during the Covid-19 pandemic because I wanted to learn new skills and have a new avenue for self-expression and creativity.',
            'Since I was young, I’ve always been fascinated by space exploration and science.  My interest was sparked when I visited the Smithsonian Udvar Hazy Air and Space Museum, where learned about the Opportunity and Spirit Mars rovers. Since then I’ve continued learning more and majored in Aerospace Engineering, so I can contribute on the next great space mission and expand the reaches of humanity.',
            'I also like to keep myself busy by gaining knowledge such as programming. Despite only taking a few programming courses at Georgia Tech, I enjoy learning about it and other subjects. Now, I’ve been learning to code from vPython to React.',
            'Outside of work or learning to code, I enjoy boxing, playing guitar, and swimming. I’ve competed in swimming throughout my life and participated in college club swimming, where we are the Champ Champs. I started boxing during my third year in college, and I’ve loved it ever since. I’m looking to complete in my first amateur match in 2021.',
            'My goals are to constantly learn, solve problems, and take those lessons to help and share with others.',
            'I’m always excited to hear from everyone, so please don’t hesitate to reach out! Thanks for checking my website out!'
