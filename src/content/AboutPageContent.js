            'I\'m currently a Bioengineering PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I also graduated with a Master\'s in Bioengineering in July 2024 and Bachelor\'s in Aerospace Engineering in May 2019. I created this website during COVID, because I wanted to learn new skills, and it seemed like a fun thing to do.',
            'Since I was young, I\'ve always been fascinated by space exploration and science. My interest was sparked when I visited the Smithsonian Udvar Hazy Air and Space Museum, where learned about the Opportunity and Spirit Mars rovers. Since then, I\'ve continued learning more and majored in Aerospace Engineering.',
            'However, I\'ve become more interested in biology and bioengineering, and now, I currently contribute to the TBI field. In the future, I seek to contribute to research in aging and reversing aging. I also like to keep myself busy by learning new skills such as programming and reading new books.',
            'Outside of school, I enjoy Brazilian jiu-jitsu, playing guitar, and creating cooking videos. Please check out my YouTube channel! Like, subscribe, comment, and share! My TikTok is also linked, so go check it out!',
            'My goals are to constantly learn, solve problems, and take those lessons to help and share with others.',
            'I\'m always excited to hear from everyone, so please don\'t hesitate to reach out! Thanks for checking my website out!'
